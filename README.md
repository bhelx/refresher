Refresher
=========

Static http server that allows you to work on some html/css/js without refreshing the browser. Works great with 2 screens.

I hacked this up one night and only later realized it has [been done before](http://aboutcode.net/vogue/). I dont plan on working on it anymore but still decided to release anyway.

Install and Run
===============

You can install via npm:

```
  npm install refresher -g
```

Cd to your root directory (currently requires index.html) and run server

```
  refresher
```

Point your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the results.

Make a change to your index.html file and watch the browser re-render.
